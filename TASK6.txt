5. With any tool of your choice (preferably cypress), create a end-to-end test (or its prototype),
that would visit the page page https://spectrocoin.com/en/bitcoin-price-rates.html, pick a
reference currency, select a currency from the list and check if its last 24 hours rate change
was positive

Check file --> CY_TASK/e2e/spec.cy.js

With no prior experience using Cypress, this was my approach for this task:
1. I found "BTC Last week change was positive" and "BTC Last 24 hours change was positive"
    since it was clear how to reache these values. Made it simple by just only checking value 
    infront of the number.
2. Tried to reach one of the values from the data-cy="rates", but then again made it simple
    by checking sign infront of the number.
